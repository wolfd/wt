# Fast, hermetic unit tests for `wt new` and `wt rm` — the paths that CREATE and DESTROY a user's
# data (no ZFS/root/docker needed).
#
# These two subcommands went untested for a long time, and the cost was invisible: you could
# delete `wt rm`'s in-use guard, or drop the provenance stamp from `wt new`, and every other suite
# stayed green. Both are silent catastrophes — the first destroys the clone out from under a
# running session; the second leaves every snapshot untagged, so `wt gc` reaps nothing, forever,
# while telling the user their own snapshots are "not wt-managed".
#
# `zfs` is a stub that models real semantics (a `list` of something that doesn't exist FAILS) and
# records its own argv, so assertions can be made about what wt actually asked ZFS to do. `git`
# is REAL, against a throwaway repo: the worktree registration and the branch archiving are the
# behaviour under test, and a git mock would only prove it agrees with itself.
