# In-namespace setup for `wt enter`. Runs as REAL ROOT (uid 0 in the container's initial userns)
# inside a fresh mount namespace from `sudo unshare --mount --propagation private`. Mounting the
# per-sandbox ZFS clone needs real CAP_SYS_ADMIN — userns CAP_SYS_ADMIN is not enough, the ZFS
# module rejects delegated mounts from a non-init userns. Once the mounts are up it drops to the
# target uid and execs the command. The mount namespace dies with this process tree, so the ZFS
# mount cleans itself up on exit; nothing to umount.

# THIS SCRIPT IS NOT A SECURITY BOUNDARY, and must not be made into one.

# It is root-equivalent BY DESIGN: running as root, it takes WT_CANONICAL, WT_SRC_CLONE, WT_PATH
# and the hook command straight from its environment, and then mounts, chowns, and `rm -rf`s with
# them. That is fine in wt's intended setting, where the user already has blanket sudo — it hands
# them nothing they did not have. It is NOT fine as a privilege gate. Do not write a "narrow"
# NOPASSWD sudoers rule for `unshare ... wt-setup.sh` believing it contains anything: whoever can
# invoke it can choose what root mounts and what root deletes. If you need a real boundary, put it
# around who may run `wt` at all.
#
# Knows nothing about any project, language or toolchain. Everything project-specific arrives as
# WT_* env from `wt`, or is done by the enter hook.
