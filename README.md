# wt

Throwaway build sandboxes that are **warm from the first second**, via per-sandbox ZFS clones.

`wt new foo` gives you an isolated checkout of your repo — sources *and* build outputs — near
instantly. Build in it immediately: nothing recompiles, because it is a copy-on-write clone of
the tree you were just working in. Break it, `wt rm foo`, and it is gone. Your main checkout was
never touched.

```
wt new   <name> [ref]         snapshot+clone your current tree (uncommitted changes and all)
wt enter <name> [-- cmd...]   enter the sandbox (default: bash)
wt list                       sandboxes, and the bytes each clone alone is holding down
wt rm    <name>               clone+snapshot destroyed; the branch is archived, not deleted
wt gc                         reclaim orphans whose sandbox is gone
wt status                     config + dataset state
```

## Why it's warm, and why that's hard to get otherwise

The usual approaches to "a second checkout" all cost you the build cache:

| approach | why the build cache dies |
|---|---|
| `git worktree` | different path → absolute paths in build artifacts miss; a fresh `target/` |
| `cp -r` the repo | different path, and you pay a full copy |
| container per branch | different path *and* different filesystem |
| shared cache dir | the compiler still re-checks and re-links everything |

`wt` sidesteps all of it with one trick: **the sandbox lives at the same path as your main
checkout.** Inside its own mount namespace, the ZFS clone is mounted *over* `$WT_CANONICAL`.
So every absolute path a build system baked into its artifacts still resolves, and the sandbox
is byte-for-byte what your working tree was — including `target/`, `build/`, `node_modules/`.

Sources and build outputs come from **one atomic snapshot**, so their mtimes stay mutually
consistent. An mtime-based build system (cargo, make, ninja) therefore sees a fully warm tree
and rebuilds exactly what you edit — no content-hashing flag, no mtime-aging hack, no path
remapping.

`zfs snapshot` and `zfs clone` take milliseconds and are copy-on-write, so a sandbox costs only
what it diverges by. `wt list` shows you that number.

## It knows nothing about your project

`wt` has no language, toolchain, daemon or cache built into it. Anything project-specific
comes from two hooks you configure:

- **`WT_HOOK_ENTER`** runs inside the sandbox namespace, as the target user, once per
  `wt enter`, before your command. Whatever `KEY=VALUE` lines it prints on stdout are exported
  into the session (direnv-style). Use it to start per-sandbox daemons and inject their env.
- **`WT_HOOK_TEARDOWN`** runs host-side when the last session exits, and on `wt rm` / `wt gc`.
  Must be idempotent. Anything the enter hook left running inside the namespace *pins the
  clone's mount* and would otherwise block `zfs destroy`.

**The enter hook's exit code gates the session: non-zero aborts `wt enter`.** That is deliberate,
and it is the one rule worth internalising before you write a hook. A sandbox that starts without
what its hook guarantees is the expensive failure — if the hook's job was to hand out a
*per-sandbox* build-daemon socket, a session that skips it falls back to the *shared* one, and
then one daemon writes every sandbox's build outputs into the wrong clone. You would not learn
that from an error message; you would learn it from a corrupt artifact, days later. So make
anything advisory `|| true`, and let a real failure stop the session. The hook's stderr goes to
your terminal, so you can see why.

The teardown hook is the opposite: its exit code is **ignored**. A sandbox whose teardown hook is
broken must still be removable.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AutoPallet/wt && cd wt
sudo ./install.sh                 # /usr/local/bin, or pass a prefix
```

Then write a config. `wt` reads `$WT_CONFIG` if set, else `~/.config/wt/config`, else
`/etc/wt/config` — and the environment overrides whatever the file says. Start from
[`wt.conf.example`](wt.conf.example):

```sh
WT_CANONICAL=/workspaces/myrepo               # required: the checkout wt clones
WT_DS_SRC=rpool/data/myrepo-src               # required: the dataset holding it
WT_DS_PARENT=rpool/data/myrepo-wt             # required: where per-sandbox clones go
WT_SNAPSHOT_EXCLUDE=logs                      # subpaths that must never enter a snapshot
WT_HOOK_ENTER='/opt/myrepo/wt-hook enter'
WT_HOOK_TEARDOWN='/opt/myrepo/wt-hook teardown'
```

Config in hand, build the datasets. Run this **on the host** and **as yourself** — it re-execs
itself under sudo for the parts that need root, and it reads the config you just wrote:

```sh
./host-zfs-setup.sh               # once per host: builds the datasets, delegates ZFS to your user
```

## Requirements

**ZFS.** Not an implementation detail to be abstracted away later — millisecond copy-on-write
snapshots *are* the tool. Also: Linux, for mount namespaces; `sudo`, because mounting a ZFS
dataset needs real root (the ZFS module refuses the mount from inside a user namespace, so
unprivileged containers alone will not do); and git ≥ 2.17, for `git worktree remove`.

**`wt` is not a privilege boundary.** It assumes you already have sudo, and it uses it to mount a
clone and then immediately drop back to your own uid — so it gives you nothing you did not
already have. But `wt-setup.sh` runs as root and takes the paths it mounts, chowns and deletes
from its environment. Do not hand it to someone you would not hand root to, and do not write a
"narrow" NOPASSWD sudoers rule for it believing that contains it: whoever can invoke it chooses
what root mounts and what root deletes. Gate who may run `wt` at all, not what it does once run.

## Backends: ZFS (default) or btrfs

The warm-sandbox trick needs one primitive: an instant, writable, copy-on-write snapshot. ZFS
provides it via `snapshot`+`clone`; **btrfs** provides it via `btrfs subvolume snapshot`. Set
`WT_BACKEND=btrfs` to use it on a host that has no ZFS (e.g. an immutable Fedora/Bazzite host,
where ZFS is a CDDL out-of-tree module you can't easily add). The zfs path is unchanged and stays
the default; everything above — the same-path overlay, the hooks, `gc`, the flock — works
identically. See [`wt.conf.example`](wt.conf.example) and `host-btrfs-setup.sh`.

Two things are genuinely different on btrfs, both forced by btrfs itself:

**It runs from inside your build container, and hops to the host for storage.** btrfs subvolume
create/delete need real root on the host (an unprivileged container's user namespace doesn't own
the host filesystem), while the per-session overlay mount only needs container-root. So `wt new` /
`wt rm` shell out to the host via `distrobox-host-exec sudo btrfs subvolume …`, and `wt enter` does
its private-namespace overlay natively in the box — which is exactly where your toolchain lives.
The source checkout (`WT_CANONICAL`) must be a btrfs **subvolume**; `host-btrfs-setup.sh` converts
it and creates the sandbox-subvolume parent.

> [!WARNING]
> **btrfs needs a passwordless (NOPASSWD) sudoers rule, and that's a real rough edge.**
> btrfs has no `zfs allow` delegation, so there is no way to let an unprivileged user snapshot or
> delete a subvolume except by granting it root for those commands. `host-btrfs-setup.sh` installs
> a sudoers rule scoped as tightly as it can — **one user, exactly `btrfs subvolume snapshot|delete`,
> restricted to the sandbox parent path** — but it *is* a standing passwordless-root grant, and any
> process running as that user can create or delete subvolumes under that parent. The setup script
> prints the exact rule and makes you confirm before installing it. This is narrower than, and
> separate from, the general "don't write a NOPASSWD rule for `wt-setup.sh`" warning above (that one
> still stands — it's about the mount path, which even on btrfs stays plain in-container sudo).

## Editor over SSH, with no listening port

`wt-ssh` runs on your machine, not in the container, and hands your editor an SSH session
*into* a sandbox over `docker exec`: sshd speaks its protocol over the pipe (`sshd -i`), so no
port is bound anywhere.

```sh
sudo ./install.sh --with-ssh      # on your machine: installs wt-ssh alongside wt
wt ssh-setup                      # inside the container, once: sshd config + authorized_keys
wt-ssh config >> ~/.ssh/config    # on your machine: one `Host wt-<name>` per sandbox
ssh wt-foo                        # or point VS Code / JetBrains at it
```

Run `wt ssh-setup` from your container's start hook (as `wt ssh-setup || true`) so it survives a
container restart.

## Two things wt refuses to do

**Destroy a snapshot it didn't create.** `wt gc` reaps only snapshots stamped with its ZFS
property (`WT_ZFS_PROP`); a name glob is not provenance. Your hand-made `@wt-backup` gets
listed for you to reap by hand, never destroyed automatically.

**Believe a marker file.** A session counts as live only while it holds an `flock`. The exit
trap never runs on SIGKILL, so a leftover marker proves nothing — but the lock dies with the
process, however the process dies. So `wt rm` can't be fooled into destroying a clone a live
session is still using, and can't be blocked forever by a sandbox that was OOM-killed a week ago.

(Anything *else* still pinning the clone's mount — a daemon that outlived its session — is killed
so the destroy can proceed. The flock protects sessions, not stragglers.)

## Tests

```sh
test/test-config-unit.sh    # config resolution (env > file > default) + the shared derivations
test/test-gc-unit.sh        # snapshot provenance: gc reaps only what wt created
test/test-backend-unit.sh   # btrfs backend: dispatch, disjointness guard, gc filter, esc hop
test/test-newrm-unit.sh     # wt new / wt rm: the create and destroy paths
test/test-hooks-unit.sh     # the hook contract, incl. the exit-code gate
test/test-marker-unit.sh    # session liveness + locking (a flock, not a pidfile)
test/test-ssh-unit.sh       # wt-ssh container resolution
```

These are hermetic: `zfs`, `git` and the hooks are stubbed on `PATH`, `docker` is a shell
function, and the `setpriv` privilege drop is disabled through its `WT_DROP_PRIV` seam. So they
need no pool, no root and no container, and they run in seconds. CI gates every pull request and
every push to `main`.

`test/spikes/` holds the standalone experiments that settled the load-bearing design questions
(does a mount namespace outlive its creator? does `flock` behave under contention? will `sshd -i`
serve a session over a pipe?). They need a real host, and they are kept because re-running them
re-proves those assumptions on your hardware.
